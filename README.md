# E-Voting_system
Electronic voting or e-voting has been used in varying forms since 1970s with fundamental benefits over paper-based systems such as increased efficiency and reduced errors. However, there remain challenges to achieve widespread adoption of such systems especially with respect to improving their resilience against potential faults.

Blockchain is a disruptive technology of current
era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems. This paper presents an 
effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to
achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental 
requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability. The paper presents 
details of the proposed e-voting scheme along with its implementation using Multichain platform. 
The paper presents in-depth evaluation of the scheme which successfully demonstrates its
effectiveness to achieve an end-to-end verifiable e-voting scheme.

WORKING DOMAIN: BLOCKCHAIN IN VOTING SYSTEM
Blockchain work in voting systems involves using blockchain technology to provide a secure,
transparent and tamper-proof platform for recording and counting votes in elections. The
blockchain-based voting system is decentralized, transparent, secure, anonymous, and uses
cryptography to ensure votes are encrypted and tamper-proof. Due to blockchain immutability,
recorded voices are immutable, providing a high level of accuracy and reliability. Blockchain 
based voting systems have the potential to address many of the challenges of traditional voting
systems, such as security, transparency and accuracy, and provide a more resilient and trusted
voting platform.
